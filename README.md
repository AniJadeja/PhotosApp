# Photos

This is my personal project.
Aimed to create a elegant photos app with performance and totally user friendly.
It will also support the one handed gestures and taps.

Pending Optimization.

- Whenever view all is pressed whole cycle runs to fetch alums. Which can be optimized.
- list of albums and thumb uri can be saved in storage so no cycle is needed.
- list of photos and videos can be saved to eliminate cycle.
- recycler view can be loaded before the time .
- While fragment transition is occuring , next fragment is blank. which can be optimized.
- Photos and Videos Adapter can be converted to media adpater
- Photos and Videos fetch can be converted to media fetch
- put the cycles and recycler adapter inside onViewCreate. This can speed up things.


THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTUNED AS OF NOW
